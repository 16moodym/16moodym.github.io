        <h1> Projects </h1>
        <h2>Bandaid Gun <I>(ME 270)</I></h2>
Was part of a group that designed and built a gun to peel and apply bandaids with one quick motion. I specifically helped CAD the trigger mechanism of the gun as well as was responsible for 3D printing and laser cutting our parts. This involved extensive work with CREO and SOLIDWORKS as well as costing software.
        <h2>Upper Testing A-Arm <I>(Offroad Illini Baja SAE)</I></h2>
As a member of the suspension team for Baja I designed new A-Arms that coul dbe used to test stresses the car encountered on different terrain. I worked with leadership to help CAD the arms as there was extensive work invovled, as well as oversaw the machining of them
        <P><h2>Lecture Desk Attachment <I>(ME 170)</I></h2>
Helped CAD and design a marketable product to college students. We created a lecture desk attachment to increase the size of the small desks present in most large lecture halls. My group received the Excellence in Design Award for our unique cost analysis that allowed us to produce our product very inexpensively.</P>
        <P><h2>Inexpensive Water Filter <I>(ENG 198)</I></h2>
My team produced a cost effective water filter to theoretically be distributed to 3rd world countries. I was part of the team building a timed circuit to turn on and off a UV light to kill bacteria in the water. I also used CAD and 3D printed an overall structure for the entire filter</P>
